Console is a class, which stores methods which can be used (things like WriteLine, ReadLine).
An Argument is placed inside the brackets after the method, which tells the method what to do.
A statement is a line of code.

Class.Method(Argument); <-- Statement

String = "string", int = 43, decimal = 6.5m, bool = true, char = 'a', 

escape characters = \n = new line, \t = new tab

declare variable eg: int myNumber = 7; string myName = George;

++ increments an integer by 1
-- decrements an integer by 1

String Concatenation = Console.WriteLine("I am " + int + " years old");
String Interpolation = Console.WriteLine($"I am {int} years old");

Taking input from user - string userInput = Console.ReadLine();

Conditional (branching) statements - if (name = George) 
										{ 
											Console.WriteLine("Hello, George!");
										} else {
											Console.WriteLine("Your name isn't George!");
										}

dotnet class library example - char favouriteLetter = Console.ReadLine();
								if (favouriteLetter.Trim().ToLower() == "a"
								{ 
									Console.WriteLine("It's A!");
								}

Creating Methods - void newMethod(string method) { --- (void is signature and indicates it won't return anything, newMethod is the name, arguments in brackets)
Methods are used when you need to use the same output in multiple areas of your code, instead of running the same statement over and over.

Simple method - birthdaySong();
				birthdaySong();
				Console.WriteLine("Happy birthday to George!");
				birthdaySong();

				static void birthdaySong()
				{
					Console.WriteLine("Happy birthday to you!");
				}

LEARN MORE ABOUT SWITCH STATEMENTS ( THEY ARE SIMILAR TO IF STATEMENTS BUT ARE CLEANER FOR MORE THAN 5 IFS )

Random number generators - int randomNumber = new Random();
							int firstNumber = randomNumber.Next(1,7) //first is inclusive, last is exclusive.
							
Turn an integer into a string int.Parse(firstNumber);

For loops - for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++)  //i is used as index. While it's less than 5, increment by one and continue the loop until it is 5.
